## Git Hooks (Husky)

This project uses Husky to enforce code quality before commits and pushes:

- **Pre-commit**: Runs linting and tests across all projects
- **Pre-push**: Runs builds across all projects to ensure everything compiles

The hooks will automatically run when you:

- `git commit` - Triggers pre-commit hook
- `git push` - Triggers pre-push hook

## CI/CD (GitHub Actions)

### CI Workflow

The CI workflow runs on every push and pull request to `main` and `develop` branches:

1. **Setup**: Node.js 20 + pnpm
2. **Install**: Dependencies with caching
3. **Lint**: Run ESLint across all projects
4. **Test**: Run Jest tests across all projects
5. **Build**: Build all projects
6. **Artifacts**: Upload build outputs for deployment

### Deployment Workflow

The deployment workflow triggers on GitHub releases:

1. **Build**: All projects
2. **Deploy**: Ready for production deployment

### Manual Trigger

You can manually trigger workflows from the GitHub Actions tab or by creating a release.
